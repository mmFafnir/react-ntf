        question: 'Why masks?',
        answer: `Genius is associated with a certain anonymity; we tend to think of talented and very skillful 
        people who stand behind great decisions and projects as of those, who usually remain behind the 
        scenes and who we do not see. Masks represent this kind of veil that conceals excellence in an 
        ordinary human being, just like you. The Mandelbrot set is a colored mathematical phenomenon that 
        perfectly goes along with the idea of our collection.`

        answer: `Right after going public, every holder will get a 3D bonus mannequin with their own unique
        features, as you may see in the team section. Besides utilizing them in our forthcoming metaverse,

        their mannequin having unique magic skills and appearance. Most details have been worked out
        already, other small features will be discussed with the community`

        question: 'What is the Mandelbrot app?',
        answer: `This is our social network. An ecosystem in your smartphone where every holder can communicate with
        each other, place tasks or project ideas, build and manage subcommunities for these projects, which
        will be represented hierarchically with their own chat and every member being assigned their own
        task. Subcommunities may interact with each other, help each other and unite to work on the same
        project. We are an open community, so each member will be able to see what subcommunities are
        working on and request to join and contribute to the project, and much more. Everyone can register
        in the app, but only the holders will have ranks and a profile pic with their masks, have access to
        community groups and chats, be able to start groups and place tasks.`

        question: 'Can I be a member of the community if I don’t have any particular skills?',
        answer: `Yes. As long as you are willing to learn or get better, we will help you get there. You will have
        access to teaching materials and constantly be around the best people in the field and even take a
        part in working on projects. Think of this as a powerful boost of your skills that will have a great
        impact on you career.`
    },
    {
        question: 'How many Mandelbrot Masks can I mint per wallet?',
        answer: `2 masks. We’re not aiming for a quick sell-out, since we look
        for long-term holders who will contribute to the community, that’s why masks left after the presale
        will be available for as long as there are people willing to join in.`
